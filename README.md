Secure Quiz App
Developed by Eric Unangst | Twitter: @unangst

Purpose:  Provide schools with a secure testing environment on Chromebooks.

When deployed in kiosk mode, this app: 
- prevents the loading any additional tabs
- prevents viewing page source / answers shown in source code

Teacher setup: Create a Google Form and generate a go.gl url to use as the access code.
Admin Setup: Contact your school's GSuite Administrator and have them deploy this app in kiosk mode.

Wish list:
- "Branded testing environment" - Site URL in header
- Color shading / "shade" which lets the teacher verify students are in Secure Testing App from a distance.
- - lime green bar clearly identifies that secure quiz app is active
